# Introduction

HALPI2 is a pre-built, ready-to-use boat computer based on the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5 (CM5). Powered by the same System-on-Chip (SoC) as the Raspberry Pi 5, it is fully compatible with all Raspberry Pi software as well as many hardware add-ons. Additionally, it offers a comprehensive set of features ideally suited for marine, automotive, and industrial applications.

## What is HALPI2?

HALPI2 represents the latest evolution in rugged embedded computing, combining the power and ecosystem of Raspberry Pi with specialized features for demanding environments. Unlike standard single-board computers, HALPI2 is engineered from the ground up for 24/7 operation in harsh conditions where reliability is paramount.

The system integrates a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5 with a custom carrier board, all housed in a waterproof aluminum enclosure that doubles as a heat sink. This design provides the computational power needed for modern applications while maintaining the robustness required for marine and industrial use.
