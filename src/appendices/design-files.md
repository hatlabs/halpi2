# Design Files and Schematics

This page provides the schematics and mechanical design files for HALPI2.

The electrical design of HALPI2 is done in KiCad. The design files are available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/hatlabs/HALPI2-hardware). Each released version has a corresponding tag in the repository.

The schematics are provided for convenience as PDF files below. The PCB layout designs are only available in the GitHub repository.

Mechanical design files are initially provided for the enclosure only. The design has been done with Autocad Fusion but the STEP format export files are readable by most CAD software.
